  <p class="subtitle"> Bacillus subtilis</p>
  
  <p>The first LDPE-degrading bacteria we recommend focusing on is Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis can grow in media containing only essential salt, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus sources. Bacillus subtilis has been one of the principal organisms used for the investigation of genetic transformation. We chose Bacillus subtilis because successful work has been done to improve the yield of surfactin it produces, it is a readily available bacteria, and it is often co-cultured with other plastic degrading bacteria, including Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, the two other bacteria we focused on.</p>
  <p>What is surfactin/Bioengineering of Bacillus subtilis srfA gene:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>First discovered in a culture broth of Bacillus subtilis, surfactin is a lipopeptide with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, which increases LDPE solubility and accelerates biofilm formation. Biofilms are communities of bacteria adhered to surfaces by an extracellular matrix. It is a secondary metabolite produced by B. subtilis that improves attachment of B. subtilis to its substrate and aids in swarming motility. The synthesis process of surfactin can be separated into three parts: the initiation of synthesis, the elongation of the peptide chain, and the cyclization of the peptide chain.</li>
  <li>In terms of strain modification to improve the production of surfactin, there are three primary strategies. The first is substituting the native promoters Psrf or srfA modules, which is important for surfactin synthesis. The second is by strengthening the production of surfactin by overexpression of assistant proteins and surfactin transporters. The third approach is to modify the transcriptional regulatory genes of srfA, which is the approach we focused on. (Hu et al.)</li>
  <li>Research has suggested that Bacillus subtilis is capable of utilizing PE as a carbon source. Additionally, evidence has shown that biosurfactants can enhance the degradation of PE, though research on this specific application is limited. (Vimala P. P., Dr. Lea Mathew, 2015)(Arkatkar et al., 2009)</li>
  <li>In the Vimala paper, it was found that the addition of biosurfactants improved Bacillus subtilis’s ability to degrade polyethylene, particularly after the polyethylene was treated using UV. Furthermore, thinner PE films displayed higher weight loss percentages, with the highest weight loss of any tested thickness being 9.26% in 30 days (18µm thickness). FTIR analysis showed that the addition of biosurfactants decreased the production of alkanes as byproducts of PE degradation.</li>
  <p>One effective modification of Bacillus subtilis was detailed in the “Systematically Engineering the Biosynthesis of a Green Biosurfactant Surfactin by Bacillus Subtilis 168” paper by Wu et al. Their strategy was as follows:</p>
  <p>“First, we restored surfactin biosynthetic activity by integrating a complete sfp gene into the nonproducing Bacillus subtilis 168 strain and obtained a surfactin titer of 0.4 g/l. Second, competition was reduced by deleting biofilm formation-related genes and nonribosomal peptide synthetases/polyketide synthase pathways (3.8% of the total genome), which increased the surfactin titer by 3.3-fold. Third, cellular tolerance to surfactin was improved by overexpressing potential self-resistance-associated proteins, which further increased the surfactin titer by 8.5-fold. Fourth, the supply of precursor branched-chain fatty acids was increased by engineering the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, resulting in an increase of the surfactin titer to 8.5 g/l (a 20.3-fold increase)... To relieve this negative feedback, we knocked out the first gene in fatty acid degradation and simultaneously overexpressed the thioesterase, TesA, from E. coli to obtain 168S22. TesA possesses high thioesterase activity for both acyl-ACP and acyl-CoA, catalyzing the synthesis of corresponding fatty acids (Runguphan and Keasling, 2014; Steen et al., 2010). Therefore, overexpression of TesA can not only release the negative feedback of long chain acyl-CoA on acetyl CoA carboxylase complex activity but also improve the intracellular fatty acid pool. Surfactin production significantly improved to 7.3 g/l in the resulting 168S22 strain...Furthermore, we speculated that simultaneously overexpressing all genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis would further enhance the branched-chain fatty acid supply by enhancing the metabolic flux through the entire pathway, and subsequently improve surfactin production. Therefore, we simultaneously strengthened the supply of branched-chain α-ketoacyl CoA and malonyl-ACP, overexpressed the fatty acid synthase complex, and integrated the expression of TesA to obtain the recombinant strain 168S23. As expected, surfactin production further improved to 8.5 g/l, which was 2.2-fold of that in the background strain 168S12.”</p>
  <p>In a different experiment by Qi Wang et al, wild type B. subtilis THY-15 produced 1.2 g/L Surfactin. It was modified by replacing the native promoter with a strong IPTG inducible promoter Pg3 (creating THY-15/Pg3-srfA), resulting in a yield of 8.2 g/L in a shaking flask. However, in a fermenter, the yield was only 5.7 g/L. This was due to the low dissolved oxygen limit during fermentation. To fix this, they co-expressed VHb (a Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene) with the improved promoter. This improved respiration as well as energy metabolism under the low-oxygen conditions. The result was a titer of 10.2 g/L in the flask and 8.6 g/L in the fermenter.</p>
