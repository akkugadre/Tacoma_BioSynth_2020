  <h1>Pseudomonas putida</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
Pseudomonas putida is a gram negative bacterium. It relies on the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and can use multiple different metabolic processes for energy production. 
P. putida grows in both soil and aquatic environments, optimally at 25-30 degrees celsius, and is easily isolated. It is saprotrophic, meaning it aids in nutrient 
cycling and decomposition. It also assists in plant development and is widely used in research on biopesticides and bacteria-remediated soil processes. P. putida 
has a diverse aerobic metabolism that effectively dissolves organic solvents and the majority of genes are for detecting chemical signals and responding to toxins. 
It can convert styrene oil to a biodegradable plastic called PHA, which aids in polystyrene degradation and is biofilm-producing. Regarding use, it’s non-pathogenic 
and generally considered safe, with the rare exception of cases of nosocomial infection in immunocompromised people. It’s versatile and easy to handle. P. putida is 
able to manage high environmental stress because of protein controls and is highly adaptable, allowing it to survive in toxic environments and convert toxins to nontoxic 
composites. (<a href="https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Pseudomonas_putida">Pseudomonas putida Microbewiki</a>)

  <h2>Alkane degradation by Pseudomonas putida</h2>
  <p>
LDPE is a polymer that is made of long chains of alkanes. Alkanes are organic compounds made up of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are chemically quite 
inert (i.e. they decompose slowly), but can be degraded by some bacteria, including Pseudomonas Putida. Though P. putida is capable of degrading Alkanes, they are not 
naturally a preferred energy source. Therefore, genetically engineering P. putida to induce increased alkane degradation is the goal. 
  </p>
  <p>
It is unclear how Pseudomonas Putida absorbs Alkanes; however, many bacteria secrete surfactants to facilitate the absorption of Alkanes. 
  </p>
  <h2>Degradation Pathways</h2>
  <p>
The P. putida alkane degradation pathway is encoded by the OCT plasmid. The genes are grouped into two clusters, alkBFGHJKL, and alkST. The alkBFGHJKL pathway is 
inactive in the absence of alkanes. The alkST operon is active. The σS‐dependent PalkS1 promoter produces very low levels of AlkS regardless of the presence or absence of 
alkanes. AlkS represses the expression of PalkS1, maintaining a low level of production.
When alkanes are present, they bind to alkS, which then binds to and activates both the PalkS2 and PalkB promoters. The activation of PalkS2 rapidly increases the production of alkS, despite the constant repression of PalkS1. When AlkS binds to PalkB it transcribes the alkBFGHJKL operon.

regulator of the Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane degradation pathway, Canosa et al</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
The alkane-degradation genes encoded by the OCT plasmid of P. putida GPo1 are clustered in two operons, and this pathway has clearly been transferred horizontally to many bacteria 
(van Beilenet al., 2001)
  </p>
  <p>
Pseudomonas putida GPo1 grows optimally on C5–C10 alkanes, but can use C3–C4and C11–C13 alkanes as well, although growth is much slower and shows a long lag time 
	  (van Beilenet al., 2005b; Johnson and Hyman, 2006), probably because these alkanes are poor inducers of the pathway genes.
