<p> This paper proposes a procedure for modifying three of the most efficient, widely researched, and readily modifiable bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The purpose of these modifications is to enhance the efficiency of degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The paper “Systematically Engineering the Biosynthesis of a Green Biosurfactant Surfactin by Bacillus Subtilis 168” by Wu et al. outlines an approach for engineering B. subtilis 168 to increase surfactin production. Surfactin is a chemical naturally produced by B. subtilis with the capacity to degrade plastic. We suggest focusing on increasing surfactin production by following three systematic engineering approaches from the paper. The first approach is deleting genes related to biofilm formation and peptide synthetase pathways to reduce competition with surfactin production for energy. The deletion of these genes increased the surfactin titer by 3.3-fold in Wu 2019. Additionally, Wu utilized promoter PP43 to overexpress target house-keeping and stress-related genes, which increased the surfactant production titer by another 8.5-fold. Thirdly, as fatty acids are a crucial component of surfactin, we recommend engineering the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis by enhancing the α- ketoacyl CoA supply and malonyl-ACP synthesis, as well as and by overexpressing the whole fatty acid synthase complex. This yielded a 20.3-fold increase in the surfactin titer (Wu 2019). The second bacteria type we focused on is Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MT45, which is a surfactin super producer (Zhi et al. 2017). As this strain already produces surfactin at an increased rate, we propose simply co-culturing it with the genetically modified strains of P. Putida and B. Subtilis. Finally, the bacteria Pseudomonas putida degrades alkanes through the gene clusters alkBFGHJKL and alkST (van Beilen et al., 2001). The alkST operon is always active, and functions as the “gatekeeper” to turn on the alkBFGHJKL pathway only in the presence of alkanes (Canosa et al., 2003). We suggest that overexpression of AlkB in P. putida would increase the rate of alkane hydroxylation, in turn increasing the rate of LDPE degradation. In summary, this procedure aims to make a better consortium of LDPE degrading bacteria; improve the LDPE degrading capabilities of P. putida, B. subtilis, and B. amyloliquefaciens; then optimize the improved versions for coculture. </p>
