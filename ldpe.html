  <p class="subtitle"> Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)</p>
    <p>There are different types of plastic that can be effectively broken down by plastic degrading bacteria. We considered studying either Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or Polyethylene (PE). PE has highly stable C−C and C−H covalent bonds, which make it difficult to break the bonds and form other substances. In contrast, PET has an ester bond, or only one carbon, and a lower crystallinity, which makes it a lot easier to break down. Despite the challenges of PE, we chose to further study it due to its prevalence in the environment and the availability of preexisting research pertaining to our topic.</p> 
    <p>Polyethylene is the most common petroleum-based plastic, 34% of the total plastics market. It is used to make grocery bags, shampoo bottles, plastic water bottles, and more. It has a very simple chemical structure, the formula (C2H4)n, which forms a long chain. There are several types of polyethylene, and each one is best suited for a different set of applications. Generally speaking, High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is much more crystalline and is often used in different circumstances than Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE). For example, LDPE is widely used in short-lived plastic packaging, such as for grocery bags or plastic wrap, while HDPE is used in more durable plastic packaging, such as shampoo bottles.</p>
    <p>LDPE is difficult to degrade due to its high molecular weight, making it harder to process using conventional methods. Due to the large number of atoms in its chain, it is capable of stretching far before bonds are broken. Furthermore, the complex network of bonds requires large amounts of energy to be broken. The high molecular weight increases the impact resistance of the material. This is because in order to rupture more polymer bonds need to be broken, and due to its large amount of bonds, the polymer can absorb more energy before failing. Additionally, chains have a tendency to bond to themselves. As chains increase in length, they become more complexly bound to themselves. This makes degradation more difficult, as the chains need to be “untangled” as well as broken down.</p>
    <p>Polyethylene is highly hydrophobic, meaning it is incapable of interacting strongly with polar molecules. This makes degradation difficult, as many known methods involve the usage of hydrophilic molecules. While this high resistance to degradation makes LDPE the perfect substance for short-lived objects, this same feature renders it worse for the environment. A high molecular weight increases the chemical resistance—to a point. It takes more damage to the main chains of the molecules before it will affect the strength of the material.</p>
    <p>The process of biodegradation of LDPE can be divided into four stages. The first stage is cells grow firmly on the surface of the plastic material and produce hydrophilic groups, meaning they have a tendency to mix or dissolve in water. After that, long-chain hydrocarbons are broken down into short chains by oxidation or hydrolysation. Enzymes produced by the microbial population are what break it down into these chains, and a new aggregated bond is formed that keeps the short chains together. Short-chain polymers are further broken down into fatty acids, which are oxidized and decomposed into H2O, CO2, and humus. </p>
