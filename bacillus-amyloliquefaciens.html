  <h1>Bacilus amyloliquefaciens</h1>
  <p>In a 2014 study Merina Paul Das and Santosh Kumar found that non-genetically modified B. amyloliquefaciens is capable of plastic degradation. Two isolated strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were found to be useful for the biodegradation of plastics (<a href="https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=0&dest=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs13205-014-0205-1">Merina Paul Das, Santosh Kumar, 2014</a>). A later study by Zhi et al showed that another strain of B. amyloliquefaciens has been found to very efficiently produce surfactin (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40976">Yan Zhi, Qun Wu & Yan Xu, 2017</a>). A study by Novotnýab et al showed that B. amyloliquefaciens can be used for treatment of ɣ-irradiation/high temperature-pretreated LLDPE qne physico-chemical analyses, which is evidence of a biodeterioration action. Following exposure to B. amyloliquefaciens, low molar weight LLDPE oligomers (a polymer whose molecules consist of relatively few repeating units) had been metabolized.

  <p>There are two important strategies when genetically engineering B. amyloliquefaciens, which are expected to help increase the rate of plastic degradation: genetic engineering to improve the catalytic activity of plastic-degrading enzymes and the development of syntrophism and cross-feeding mechanisms in enriched microbial communities.
