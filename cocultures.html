  <h1>Cocultures</h1>
    <h2>Engineering a coculture</h2>
    <p> Cocultures (otherwise known as mixed cultures or microbial consortia) are colonies of bacteria that not only live together, but also employ a division of labor. The phrase "microbial consortia" can refer to a single species, two species, or several species.</p>
    <p>There are two main methods of creating synthetic microbial consortia. The first one is to re-engineer naturally occurring microbial consortia, which is a top-down method. In this method, the molecular mechanisms for the maintained systems would be explored based on multiple omics analysis, starting from the macroscopic microbial consortia and parsing the system principles.</p>
    <p>The second method is to create artificial microbial consortia, which is a bottom-up method.This method would use genetic elements, modules, circuits and metabolic pathways or networks to engineer a microbial consortia with higher efficiency, stability, and controllability.</p>
    <p>We recommend the bottom-up method for the microbial consortia of Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens. Considering the complexity and practicability of synthetic biology, currently the bottom-up method is most widely used for constructing microbial consortia from simple to complicated.

      <li>Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were successfully cocultured with Bacillus mojavensis and Bacillus pumilus. They can exist naturally together in the rhizosphere, and are recommended for speeding up plant growth.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.14273">Y. He, H.A. Pantigoso, Z. Wu 2019</a></li>
