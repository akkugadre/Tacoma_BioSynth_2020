  <p class="subtitle> Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)</p>
            <p> Most common petroleum-based plastic, 34% of total plastics market. It is used to make grocery bags, shampoo bottles, plastic water bottles and such. Very simple chemical structure, formula is (C2H4)n, forms a long chain.There are several types of polyethylene, and each one is best suited for a different set of applications. Generally speaking, High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is much more crystalline, and is often used in entirely different circumstances than Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE). For example, LDPE is widely used in plastic packaging, such as for grocery bags or plastic wrap. </p>
            <h2> Difference between Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyethylene</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>PET is a lot easier to break down because it has ester bonds, only has one carbon in the bond.</li>
              <li>PE has a higher crystallinity, how neatly the bonds are put together, is more organized and harder to break down.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2> Resistance to biodegradation</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>PE’s highly stable C−C and C−H covalent bonds, difficult to break bonds and form into something else.</li>
              <li>Its high molecular weight (large size because it is a very long chain of atoms), which:
                <ul>
                <li>increases how far the material can stretch before rupturing. The material can be pulled further before the chains break.</li>
                <li>increases the impact resistance of the material. The higher degree of entanglement means that in order to rupture, more polymer bonds need to be broken, this means that the polymer can absorb more energy before failing.</li>
                <li>increases the chemical resistance - to a point. It takes more damage to the main chains of the molecules before it will affect the strength of the material.</li>
                <li>increases the viscosity of the material – makes it harder to process the material using conventional methods. The longer the chains, the harder it is to get them to flow because they are more tangled.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>PE is toughest plastic to break down in general</li>
              <li>It is highly hydrophobic, which makes it difficult to break down (it won’t interact strongly with polar molecules)</li>
              </ul>
