  <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>Hello internet traveler. Welcome to our research pages. Here you can learn all about the problem we are trying to address, as well as our proposed solutions. Feel free to explore the following tabs for more information:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about <a href="ldpe.html">LDPE</a>, the plastic that started our investigation.</li>
      <li>Learn about <a href="bacillus-subtilis.html">Bacillus subtilis</a>, an LDPE-degrading bacterium, and how it can be engineered to maximize plastic degradation.</li>
      <li>Learn about <a href="bacillus-amyloliquefaciens.html">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</a>, a well-characterized plastic degrader, and its potnential modifications.</li>
      <li>Learn about <a href="pseudomonas-putida.html">Pseudomonas putida</a>, another LDPE-degrading bacterium</li>
      <li>Learn about how these three bacteria can be <a href="cocultures">cocultured</a>.</li>
      <li>See our <a href="works-cited.html">works cited</a>.</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Important Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Alkanes:</em> Organic compounds made up of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms</li>
        <li><em>Catabolic repression:</em> When other carbon sources are present, the bacteria are often not able to use hydrocarbons as carbon sources (catabolic repression). This is due to global regulatory responses for E. Coli and B. Subtilis (the bacteria do not have the same process). It is unclear how regulation of the hydrocarbon pathways works in Pseudomonas, but evidence points to the fact that not only catabolic repression but also other signals, control the expression of hydrocarbon pathways. (LDPE is a hydrocarbon)</li>
        <li><em>Biofilms:</em> Biofilms are communities of bacteria adhered to surfaces by an extracellular matrix; such biofilms can have important effects in both clinical and agricultural settings.</li>
        <li><em>srfA:</em> Operon required for surfactin production.</li>
        </ul>
