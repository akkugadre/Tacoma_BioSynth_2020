  <p class="subtitle"> Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)</p>
            <p> Most common petroleum-based plastic, 34% of total plastics market. It is used to make grocery bags, shampoo bottles, plastic water bottles and such. Very simple chemical structure, formula is (C2H4)n, forms a long chain.There are several types of polyethylene, and each one is best suited for a different set of applications. Generally speaking, High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is much more crystalline, and is often used in entirely different circumstances than Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE). For example, LDPE is widely used in plastic packaging, such as for grocery bags or plastic wrap. </p>
            <h2> Difference between Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyethylene</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>PET is a lot easier to break down because it has ester bonds, only has one carbon in the bond.</li>
              <li>PE has a higher crystallinity, how neatly the bonds are put together, is more organized and harder to break down.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2> Resistance to biodegradation</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>PE’s highly stable C−C and C−H covalent bonds, difficult to break bonds and form into something else.</li>
              <li>Its high molecular weight (large size because it is a very long chain of atoms), which:
                <ul>
                <li>increases how far the material can stretch before rupturing. The material can be pulled further before the chains break.</li>
                <li>increases the impact resistance of the material. The higher degree of entanglement means that in order to rupture, more polymer bonds need to be broken, this means that the polymer can absorb more energy before failing.</li>
                <li>increases the chemical resistance - to a point. It takes more damage to the main chains of the molecules before it will affect the strength of the material.</li>
                <li>increases the viscosity of the material – makes it harder to process the material using conventional methods. The longer the chains, the harder it is to get them to flow because they are more tangled.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>PE is toughest plastic to break down in general</li>
              <li>It is highly hydrophobic, which makes it difficult to break down (it won’t interact strongly with polar molecules)</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>LDPE Degradation via Wax Worms</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>The process of biodegradation can be divided into four stages: (a) cells grow firmly on the surface of the plastic material and produce hydrophilic groups; (b) long-chain hydrocarbons are oxidized or hydrolyzed into short chains by enzymes produced by microbial population, and a new aggregated bond is formed; (c) short-chain polymers are further broken down into fatty acids; (d) fatty acids are oxidized and decomposed into H2O, CO2, and humus</li>
              <li>Achieved by photo-oxidation(Photo-oxidation is the degradation of a polymer surface in the presence of oxygen or ozone. The effect is facilitated by radiant energy such as UV or artificial light) or thermo-oxidation(high temperature oxidation)and then through the biological activity of microorganisms.When PE samples are pretreated with UV light or thermo-oxidation, depolymerization(converts polymer into a bunch of monomers) of the PE chains occurs and results in the formation of low molecular weight products, (in this case includes alkanes, alkenes, ketones, aldehydes, various alcohols and fatty acids) which are then further degraded by select microorganisms. Microorganisms can break them down from this point because decreased hydrophobicity of the polymer, making it more compatible with microorganisms, or groups such as CO or −OH introduced, which are more prone to microbial degradation. There is a lack of speciﬁc plastic-degrading microorganisms with long carbon chain oxidation and depolymerization capabilities.
</li>
              <li>Wax worms and bacteria (Enterobacter asburiae YT1 and Bacillus sp. YP1) in their gut that degrade this kind of plastic are a rare source of plastic-degrading microorganisms.</li>
              <li>Pace of degradation of PE: 100 wax worms left on a commercial polyethylene shopping bag for 12 hours, and the worms consumed and degraded about 92 milligrams, or roughly 3 percent, of it.</li>
              <li>The larvae's ability to break down their dietary staple—beeswax—also allows them to degrade plastic. Wax is a complex mixture of molecules, but the basic bond in polyethylene, the carbon-carbon bond, is in wax as well, the wax worm evolved a mechanism to break this bond, that is why the microbes in their gut can break down PE and other plastics, both a carbon chain.</li>
              <li>Feeding wax worms honeycomb makes them break down more plastic</li>
              <li>Although PET is a resistant material, one might expect its biodegradation to be easier than PE, as PET has a polyester backbone and can be hydrolysed(break down (a compound) by chemical reaction with water).</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Other Forms of Degradation</h2>
              <ul>
              <li>Slow PE degradation was recorded after 4 to 7 months exposure to the bacterium Nocardia asteroides (bacteria responsible for nocardia pneumonia, present mainly in soil)</li>
              <li>Modest degradation of PE was observed after nitric acid treatment and incubation for 3 months in a liquid culture of the fungus Penicillium simplicissimum(a fungus that can promote plant growth)</li>
              <li>Faster degradation of PET reported by bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis, a bacteria capable of breaking down and consuming the plastic PET as a sole carbon and energy source.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Conversion of LDPE to Ethylene Glycol</h2>
              <p>Test for formation of an absorbance peak (A wavelength of maximum electromagnetic absorption by a chemical sample; used to identify specific elements, radicals, or compounds) around 3,300 cm-1, a signature for ethylene glycol</p>
