	<h2>Jenna</h2>
	<p>Jenna is the teams's PI.</p>
  </div>
  <div id='Akalpit'>
	<img src="Images/Akalpit.png"></img>
	<h2>Akalpit</h2>
	<p>Akalpit is the Wiki team cheer leader. He enjoys working with future scientists and engineers. He is a nerd and excited about STEM education.</p>
  </div>
  <div id='Catherine'>
	<img src="Images/Catherine.png"></img>
	<h2>Catherine</h2>
	<p>Catherine is a Biotech/Molecular Bio major at Rochester Institute of Technology (class of 2024). She&#39;s a fan of wind, really digs dirt, and thinks comedy is a cornerstone of society. Fondly called &quot;obsessive&quot; and &quot;a workaholic&quot; she&#39;s prone to late nights, early mornings, and generally stressing herself out. Despite recently starting college, Catherine refuses to retire from the team and still attends as many meetings as she can.</p>
  </div>
  <div id='Caroline'>
	<img src="Images/Caroline.png"></img>
	<h2>Caroline</h2>
	<p>Caroline is a Junior at Stadium High School who joined Tacoma Biosynth to make pink gels and have fun doing science with our wonderful team. In her time off she can be found trying to sew socks (one day she&#39ll figure it out), planning for the next April Fools, and, for some strange reason, running long distances. Caroline enjoys proving that anyone can fit an hour of research on two notecards if the writing is small enough and the pink pen is fine enough. </p>
  </div>
  <div id='Max'>
    <img src="Images/Max.jpg"></img>
	<h2>Max</h2>
	<p>Max is a student at the Science and Math institute (class of 2021). Despite his powerful strength as a follower, he somehow ended up as a design/media leader. When he&#39;s not confusing himself and his subteam with scheduling, he&#39;s probably keeping carbohydrated with ungodly quantities of pasta, listening to 80s and weird alternative music, plotting his escape to Canada and/or Iceland, making pun-ishably bad jokes, or guzzling tea. He is also a member of his school&#39;s Gender and Sexuality Alliance, Newspaper Club, Feminist Club, and Envirothon team. The first words that he spoke at the dawn of the new decade were: &#34;wait, what?&#34; which pretty much embodies his personality. This is his second year on the Tacoma RAINmakers/BioSynth team. Last year he helped lift his team to international fame by putting down some questionable answers to puzzles.</p>

  <div id='Anna'>
	<img src="Images/Anna.png"></img>
	<h2>Anna</h2>
	<p>Anna is an undergraduate student at Washington State University, majoring in Animal Sciences with a Pre-Vet path. Whenever she is not working as an office assistant, writing children&#39;s stories, doing school stuff, or working with animals, she can be found hanging out with friends, listening to music, stressing about anything and everything in life, or deciding what to eat, because she can never figure out what she wants. She can also be found reading, especially since her classes have all gone online, including the 3.5 science classes she&#39;s taking. She likes to think that she&#39;s fine with this, but to prove she&#39;s not: she went to Half Price Books and bought 7 vet-related books, including a Veterinary Dictionary, which she may love more than she likes to admit. Anna has contributed to the team by waiting until the last minute to thoroughly complete her work. Hey, at least she completed it, and learned a ton in the process!</p>

  <div id='Daniel'>

	<h2>Daniel</h2>
	<p>Daniel Neshyba-Rowe is currently a senior in high school at the Tacoma Science And Math institute (SAMi). Daniel's biggest passion is all things computer science, and his biggest fear is all things writing, so he thought, "what better thing to do than combine them?" And joined the wiki team. His hobbies include: procrastinating on essays, wondering why the "And" is capitalized in SAMi, but the "institute" is not, and going on hikes with his family.</p>

  <div id='Gracie'>
	<img src="Images/Gracie.png"></img>
	<h2>Gracie</h2>
	<p>Gracie Kim is a Senior at Annie Wright Schools. She joined BioSynth because she was interested in STEM fields and bored out of her mind amidst the pandemic. When she&#39;s not crying over test grades, Gracie can be found writing jazz compositions, taking fencing lessons, and practicing violin, piano, or bassoon (all of which she is subpar at). At school, she is involved in the Science Team, Orchestra, and Honor Council. In the future, Gracie aspires to finally get some rest before college.

  <div id='Henry'>
	<img src="Images/Henry.png"></img>
	<h2>Henry</h2>
	<p>Henry is a senior at the Science and Math Institute. Henry is on a quest to halt the rapidly declining animal populations around the world. To aid him on his mission, he joined Tacoma Biosynth. In school Henry is known for his special interests in marine environments and how to assist them so they can recover. Henry is the leader of his school&#39;s ORCA bowl and Envirothon team, and participates in many more academic teams. Henry intends to continue his studies and seeks higher education in search for answers to his queries. In the meantime Henry dedicates his out of school time to his internship relating to marine and aquatics. </p>

	<h2>Kaitlin</h2>
    <p>Kaitlin is a student at the University of Puget Sound studying molecular biology. When she&#39s not battling her supreme nemesis, non-automatic doors, she loves taking care of her leaf-babies, contemplating the end of time, appreciating nature, and baking the best banana bread in the neighborhood. She drinks lots of water because she appreciates her internal organs, and she wants her internal organs to appreciate her back. She is also involved in scouting, and is currently working on building a greenhouse for her Eagle service project. Her biggest contribution to the success of the team was making the potato in the logo extra purple, so the common folk of society may gaze upon his beauty. Yes, the logo potato is a he, and his name is Sir Potatio (pronounced poh-tay-shee-oh).</p>
  </div>
  <div id='Marisa'>
	<img src="Images/Marisa.png"></img>
	<h2>Marisa</h2>
	<p>Marisa is a junior at Stadium High School. She loves reading, biking, napping, paddle boarding, she&#39;s undecided on hiking, going to the beach and lately she spends a lot of her time running after her new puppy. She also enjoys volunteering at Mary Bridge children's hospital, where she occasionally plays with children, but mostly takes trips to the cafeteria for lemon bread. Marisa is someone who loves to go just about anywhere, which is unfortunate in the midst of the COVID pandemic, but when it&#39;s over she plans to take many road trips and fly to many countries. Eventually Marisa would like to become an Epidemiologist and study diseases, especially in developing countries. Until then, she's happy soliciting sarcastic comments and unwanted random facts.</p>

  <div id='Tara'>
	<img src="Images/Tara.png"></img>
	<h2>Tara</h2>
	<p>Tara is a sophomore at Foss High School and was thrown into the fun that is Tacoma BioSynth for the first time amid the pandemic. That ride has consisted of being very quiet and confused but having a lot of fun listening to and learning from the rest of the team. Which is fantastic because she&#39s here to learn about super cool applied science, a topic second only to math. When Tara isn&#39t doing school work she&#39s still at school prepping for math team competitions, having fun with the Reader&#39s and Writer&#39s Club and GSA, or running&#8230 very slowly. Outside school Tara writes silly things, eats a lot of popcorn, and plays D&D. In the future Tara hopes to continue doing research, use math and science to save the planet and provide solutions that get us closer to a just and equitable world.</p>
  </div>
  <div id='Zoha'>
	<img src="Images/Zoha.png"></img>
	<h2>Zoha</h2>
	<p>Zoha is currently a junior at Charles Wright Academy and joined Tacoma BioSynth because she wanted to end world hunger. Unfortunately, she can&#39t do that on her own, so she decided that researching bacterial plastic degradation at Tacoma BioSynth was a good alternative. Apart from that, Zoha enjoys playing tennis, teasing her sister, and occasionally reading a book. Looking to the future, she hopes to continue to pursue research and eventually become a doctor.</p>
